    <h2>A Fun Family</h2>
    <p>Our family loves to have fun together, sometimes we just sit on the ground and play with
    toys, pretending to be heroes and villians. Mom has introduced a lot of different activities
     to the children, like simon says, duck-duck-goose, hide-and-seek, ring-around-the-rosie,
    tag, and a bunch of other fun stuff.</p>
    <p>During the summer semester dad is super busy with school work, practically working 24/7
    just so that he doesn't turn in an assignment late, so mom has taken over and the boys
    are having more fun than ever. They go outside all the time and get to have tons of
    outdoor fun at places like the park, beach, and to the movies.</p>
    <p>
      One thing that we all have fun doing is playing video games. I myself have been playing
      video games since I was two years old, it was always a dream of mine to create a family
      of gamers. Now I have one. Each day the kids get an alotted amount of time to play video
      games while me and my partner Alyssa try to get a couple games in every night if possible.
      Lately, we haven't been able to play as much as ususal but when we do it is so much fun.
      We started with Call of Duty but then we switched to halo, here is a video clip of our
      gameplay.
