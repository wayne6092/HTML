    <h2>Educational accomplishments.</h2>
    <p>Besides Preston, all of my children have had a chance to be in school for a whole year
    which is exciting for me as a dad. I was so happy that both of my Jaspers enjoyed
    Head Start pre-school. Preston will be going to the same pre-school next year too!
    At first, it was difficult getting them up in the morning, but once
    we started our weekly routine it became easy. Tobias (The oldest) just completed
    his first year in public school and he made so many new friends. Tobias also
    learned how to do math, read, write, and rhyme. It was hard for Tobias at first
    because of covid, he was doing online school for a while but it just didn't work out
    so we put him in-person and never went back. No one in my family has gotten Covid,
    thank goodness.</p>
    <p>All of the kids received good grades, and the younger boys were well-behaved.</p>
    <p>
      Below are some pictures of what they accomplished during the past year of school.
