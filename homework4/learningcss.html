      <h3>Paris</h3>
      <p><strong>Bonjour from Paris, France!</strong></p>
      <img src="images/boullaysnow.jpg" alt="Snowfall in Boullay" width="250" height="188" title="Snowfall in Boullay">
      <p>In Paris and around France winter has been mild. We had one day of winter in Boullay We had one morning of snow that turned everything into a fairyland of whiteness. Then by early afternoon all the snow had melted.</p>
      <p>It's been cool and quite rainy - not really warm yet, but the spring bulbs are poking their heads out of the ground and saying "I am ready to bloom."</p>
      <p>With morning temperatures from 3 to 5 Centigrade you'll probably still want to pack a warm coat. The afternoon temperatures are close to 15 degrees.</p>
      <p>Do dress in layers so you can be in your sweater or T-Shirt enjoying a drink at a Parisian caf&eacute; in the afternoon.</p>

      <h3>Montmartre</h3>
      <img src="images/eiffeltower.jpg" alt="The Eiffel Tower" width="225" height="203" title="The Eiffel Tower">
      <p>I had a wonderful short break to Lyon, going by TGV. Can you imagine... our first class tickets were less than the 2nd class trip? See my story on train travel in France.</p>
      <p><strong>Eiffel Tower Lyon</strong> has so many restaurants and our Friday evening meal was at Le Caro de Lyon. Delightful decor - you eat in the middle of a library and the food was ever so good. See my restaurant review for more details.</p>
      <p><strong>Montmartre</strong> is a favorite place to visit in Paris and Thirza Vallois tells a wonderful tale.</p>
      <p class="quote">"With spring round the corner Montmartre calls, but with the weather being unpredictible, why not take shelter at le Lapin Agile late into the night. If the weather is with you, explore the neighbourhood earlier on in the day, on the vineyard's and the museum side rather than the touristy Place du Tertre." </p>
