									<h1>This is<br />
									Why I Love Cats So Much</h1>
									<p>My mom was cat crazy, and I think that is how the rest of my family became obsessed with them too.
									We had more cats than what a single person could handle, so my mom eventually taught us how to care for
									them, what they like to play with, and all about catnip.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/cat1.png" title="sniffing cat" alt="Cat that sniffs at you" /></div>
								<p>We would pet them, love them, feed them, and go to sleep with them. Our cats were always with us.
								Fatso and rockstar really were the best cats in the world. When they finally had their litter, it was in the same week.
								After the kittens were born my mom set up a nursing area for the cats in a closet where the mommy cats fed their baby
								kittens. The really cool thing about this was that when Rockstar needed a break, fatso would step in and feed Rockstar's
							  litter. I was only six years old when I witnessed the feline cooperation, I was astounded, and I thought it was beautiful.
								Of course, there are some cats that just don't want anything to do with humans, and that's cool too but those are cats I don't
								really like a whole lot.</p>
								<p>Since most of the cats that we had in Warren were born into our family we never had issues with their behavior, they were
								always good to us, and they were kind to our guests too. The cats in our house would follow you until you gave them love,
								and would go as far as circling around your ankles to get your attention and a few minutes of petting time. Many of the adult
								cats would sit and wait until you sat down on the living room sofa to pounce into your lap, where you would have no choice but
								to pet them.</p>
								<p>Another reason why I love cats is that they like to remove rodents from their territory. My mother has shown me on several
								occasions dead mice caught by our beloved Oreo, and sometimes he would catch birds, although that would make me sad it made me
								happy knowing that he was a successful hunter.</p>
