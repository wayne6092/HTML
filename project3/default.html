									<h1>This is a<br />
									Cat lover website</h1>
									<p>Ever since I was a little boy we have always had animals around, whether it was
									cat's or dog's. My mom liked to take care of animals a lot, and she would save whatever
									animal came to her doorstep. When we lived in Warren, Michigan she had kept about 12 Cats
									inside our home, but they didn't start out as adult cats and she didn't start with 12.
									My mom adopted one male cat named oreo, and two female cats named rockstar and fatso.
									Before we knew it both female cats were pregnant. Both mommy cats had a litter of 6, and
									thats how my love for cats started.</p>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/cats.png" title="Awesome picture of cats" alt="Picture of eight cats" /></div>
								<p>Every day that I woke up, I would wake up to a cat sleeping on my head, or it would be licking the inside of my ear
								which I always thought was wierd, but funny. If the cats were not fed on time, all of them would start crying at the same
								time, mimicing the noise of ambulance blaring its emergency sirens.</p>
								<p>I didn't mind the licking or the noise because I loved my furballs a lot, and they were always so playful and loving
								to me and my sisters. We grew to love our feline companions, and they became part of our small family. When it comes
								to the species of the cats, don't ask me, I am pretty sure that they were all tabbys or outdoor cats, but my family loved
								them all the same.</p>
								<p>We had so many cats all the time, and honestly, it was a blessing and a curse. Although, there was always something
								warm and fuzzy laying around for you to cuddle with or give your affection too, they can also be a handful, they have needs
								and must be taken care of. Some more than others. Many times our cats would roam away from the house to come back with cuts
								or bites from other animals. My mom would tell me that they get into fights with stray cats, but our cats win because they are
								well fed and taken care of, so there is nothing to worry about. Of course there were several occasions where one of our cats
								would need to be taken to the vet but that was about it. They were good cats, and I know that they just wanted to be free.
								We wouldn't keep them inside the house, so we just had to give them flea medicine every once in a while to keep the critters away.</p>
