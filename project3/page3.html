									<h1>This is<br />
									Facts about cats!</h1>
									<p>I have been around cats as long back as I can remember, and I was fascinated with all the cool things they could
									do, when I was little I liked to think that cats had superpowers. I mean, they kind of do. Here is a story about my cat
									Oreo, when me and my sister walked to school every morning my cat Oreo would accompany us all the way to the playground
									at the school, and he would sit and wait until we went inside. Funny enough, when school let us out, Oreo was there waiting
									for us. This was normal for us, and when I ask my mom about it now she tells me that Oreo would come home after he dropped
									us off at school and would pick us up too. Pretty cool huh!</p>

								<p>Anyways, in this page I want to talk about all the cool and weird facts humans know about cats, here we go!</p>
								<hr>

						<h3>Facts about cats:</h3>
						<dl>
							<dt>Its Sweet?</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>Cats are believed to be the only mammals who don’t taste sweetness.</p>
							</dd>
							<dt>Nightvision</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>Cats are nearsighted, but their peripheral vision and night vision are much better than that of humans.
								This helps cats when they are searching for dinner in the night time.</p>
							</dd>
							<dt>Hops</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>Cats can jump up to six times their length. I have seen my cat jump from the kitchen floor and on to the
								top of my fridgerator before, I definitely believe this.</p>
							</dd>
							<dt>Great Climbers!</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>Cats’ claws all curve downward, which means that they can’t climb down trees head-first. Instead, they have to back down the trunk.
								This is pretty cool if you think about it cats are like rock climbers, but with claws. I always thought it was funny wathcing my Cats
								climb down from the tops of trees, because they hug the tree all the way down.</p>
							</dd>
							<dt>Cats can taste what they smell</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>Cats have an extra organ that allows them to taste scents on the air, which is why your cat stares at you with her mouth open from time to time.
								My cats are always sniffing up into the air, especially when me or my family cooks meat.</p>
							</dd>
							<dt>Balance</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>Cats use their long tails to balance themselves when they’re jumping or walking along narrow ledges. I have witnessed cats balancing themeselves
								on the tops of doors that were open, which is an awful place for a cat to be, but he liked being there for some unknown reason.</p>
							</dd>

							<dt>Whiskers for what?</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>Cats use their whiskers to “feel” the world around them in an effort to determine which small spaces they can fit into. A cat’s whiskers are
									generally about the same width as its body. (This is why you should never, EVER cut their whiskers.) My dads cat Bosco was a yellow tabby with
								  abnormally long whiskers, apparently his whiskers are about two inches longer than what was genetically considered normal.</p>
							</dd>
							<dt>Wait? Thats how they walk?</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>Cats walk like camels and giraffes: They move both of their right feet first, then move both of their left feet. No other animals walk this way.
								Its funny, all my life having cats I have never really noticed that they walked so differently.</p>
							</dd>
							<dt>Right pawed, left pawed, ambidextrous?</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>Some cats are ambidextrous, but 40 percent are either left- or right-pawed. When I read this fact I lost my mind, I had no idea that they could
								have a naturally favorite appendage like we humans do, or that there were cats that were naturally more talented than me.</p>
							</dd>
							<dt>Cats can be lazy</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>According to The Huffington Post, cats typically sleep for 12 to 16 hours a day. Which sounds wonderful, I think I would like to be a cat for a while.</p>
							</dd>
							<dt>Crepscular?</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>Cats are crepuscular, which means that they’re most active at dawn and dusk. So cats are up and moving before the day ends and before the
								day begins, wow. Cats really are something else.</p>
							</dd>
							<dt>Grooming</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>Cats can spend up to a third of their waking hours grooming. This fact is outrageous, and probably true. Everytime I look at my cats
								they are either licking their fur or they are eating or napping.</p>
