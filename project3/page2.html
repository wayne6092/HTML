									<h1>This is<br />
									A Page About My Cats</h1>
									<p>From about the age of two was when my mom started bringing cats to our home, she would say that she just wanted to
									help them get to good health, but after she gave the cat a name it became family. I don't remember the first cat, but
								  I remember a lot of them.</p>

						<h3>Remembered Cats</h3>
						<p>Here is a list of names I remember and other information that I can come up with:</p>
						<dl>
							<dt>Fatso</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>A white haired cat, not really sure what kind of cat she was, but she was a good mom to her six kittens. and she was
								a very loving cat, who loved to sit in my lap.</p>
								<img src="images/catw.png" width="100" height="100" title="Awesome picture of cats" alt="Picture of eight cats" />
							</dd>
							<dt>Rockstar</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>A black, white, and gray haired cat, she was a very assertive mom, she was always on top of the kittens like it was her job to protect them
								all, and she was good at it, when we took the kittens outside, Rockstar was always there watching out for them, or playing with
							  them.</p>
								<img src="images/cat2.png" width="100" height="100" title="Black white and gray cat" alt="Medium sized black white and gray colored cat" />
							</dd>
							<dt>Oreo</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>He had mostly black sleek fur all around, but his underbelly was completely white, which is why we called him oreo in the first place.
								Oreo is the father of all of the twelve kittens, he was there for the little ones when they were born, and he stayed with the moms for about
							  a month before he started leaving the house every day again, like he used to.</p>

							</dd>
							<dt>Star</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>A bobcat tabby mix, who had camouflage patterned fur, and the color was black and brown. When we moved to Ohio, we lived by the woods
								and my mom would feed the stray cats who lived in the woods, and one day a big bob cat started walking up into our backyard connected to the
							  forest. My mom saw the bobcat, and she said that it was holding a kitten by the skin of its neck, like mother cats do. Then my mom opened the
								door to the approaching cat, who then drops the kitten on the doorstep in front of my mom. It was the winter time, so I guess the mommy cat
							  thought that her baby had a better chance of survival living with caring humans, than in a cold forest with little food.</p>

							</dd>
							<dt>Magic</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>An all black cat, and was the second cat that was dropped off by the bobcat mother before taking off into the forest. My mom said the mom
								cat never came back. My mom took both of the kittens in and gave them a new life. Both cats grew up to be wonderful house cats, who loved us
								and we loved to give them our affection.</p>
