My HTML, CSS, and JavaScript projects from ITWP 1000, web programming class
These projects are my portfolio for the summer semester at Macomb Community College.
Projects completed in the course taught me the important guidelines set by the W3C and other web structure regulators wish to abide by. Throughout the course I have
learned how to integrate the three languages, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a beautiful and well-functioning website.
The following homework assignments and projects are pubilcly available to show my aptitude for programming websites.
