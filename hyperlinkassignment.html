<h2>Lose Yourself Lyrics</h2>

    <a id="v1"></a>Look<br>
    If you had<br>
    One shot<br>
    Or one opportunity<br>
    To seize everything you ever wanted<br>
    In one moment<br>
    Would you capture it<br>
    Or just let it slip?<br>
</p>

<p>
    <a id="v2"></a>Yo<br>
    His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy<br>
    There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti<br>
    He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready<br>
    To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'<br>
    What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud<br>
    He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out<br>
    He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now<br>
    The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow<br>
    Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity<br>
    Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked<br>
    He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No<br>
    He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes<br>
    It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke<br>
    He's so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's<br>
    Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody<br>
    Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him<br>
</p>

<p>
    <a id="v3"></a>You better lose yourself in the music, the moment<br>
    You own it, you better never let it go<br>
    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime<br>
</p>

<p>
    <a id="v4"></a>You better lose yourself in the music, the moment<br>
    You own it, you better never let it go<br>
    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime<br>
    You better<br>
</p>

<p>
    <a id="v5"></a>His soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping<br>
    This world is mine for the taking<br>
    Make me king, as we move toward a New World Order<br>
    A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortem<br>
    It only grows harder, only grows hotter<br>
    He blows, it's all over, these girls is all on him<br>
    Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter<br>
    Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father<br>
    He goes home and barely knows his own daughter<br>
    But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water<br>
    These girls don't want him no mo', he's cold product<br>
    They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada<br>
    So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on<br>
    Da-da-dum, da-dum, da-da<br>
</p>

<p>
    <a id="v6"></a>You better lose yourself in the music, the moment<br>

    <a id="v7"></a>You better lose yourself in the music, the moment<br>

    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime<br>
    You better<br>

<p>
    <a id="v8"></a>No more games, I'ma change what you call rage<br>
    Tear this motherfudgin' roof off like two dogs caged<br>
    I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed<br>
    I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage<br>
    But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher<br>
    Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper<br>
    All the pain inside amplified by the<br>
    Fact that I can't get by with my nine to<br>
    Five and I can't provide the right type of<br>
    Life for my family 'cause man, these Sudan food stamps don't buy diapers<br>
    And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer<br>
    This is my life and these times are so hard<br>
    And it's getting even harder tryna feed and water my seed, plus<br>
    Teeter totter, caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna<br>
    Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much<br>
    For me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony's<br>
    Gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got<br>
    To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot<br>
    Success is my only motherfudgin' option, failure's not<br>
    Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot<br>
    So here I go, is my shot<br>
    Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got<br>
